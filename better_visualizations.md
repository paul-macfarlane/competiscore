# Better Visualizations

I am running an event right now that has several tournaments, 2 teams, best score sessions, etc.

Right now I like how the home page shows the total points as well as points over time. I also like the scoring history log.

That being said, I think the area with the pie charts could use some improvement, they might not even need to be pie charts. Ultimately, I just want a good way to view the top individual scorers for the event.

Help me ideate ways to improve the individual breakdown, and also try to come up with other cool visualizations that we can do!
