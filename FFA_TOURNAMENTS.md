# FFA Tournaments

The beyblade finals will be structured as follows:

16 participants, with 4 groups of 4 participants each. The winner of each group will advance to the finals, which is also a group of 4 and then winner of that wins.

The Katan Tournament will be structured as tables, where the winner of each table advances to the final table.

So for beyblades, what we really need is to allow for is a tournament of free for alls, where the top X participants advance to the next round. This is a symetrical bracket. Katan is a little different because its just the winner of each table table moves to the next, but there could be anywhere form 3-6 tables.

Help me update the app to support this. Come up with an implemnentation plan and ask clarification questions where needed.
